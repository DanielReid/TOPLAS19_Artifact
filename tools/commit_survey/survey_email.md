Dear PARTICIPANT_NAME,

Thank you for offering to help us with our study!

For the given set of Git commits, you will be asked whether each commit is a bug fix.
No in-depth knowledge of the programming language is necessary. If you are not completely certain, just make a best guess.

Begin the data collection survey by visiting the following link:

http://ginger.ele.fit.cvut.cz/~celeste/commit_survey/commit_study.php/?token=PARTICIPANT_TOKEN

Please do not share this link with anybody else. It is yours alone.

You do not have to classify all of the commits in one sitting.
Feel free to leave the survey and continue again by following the above link. 
Your labels will be automatically saved.

Feel free to email any questions or concerns, and please let me know when you are done.

Thank you for your help,
