The following command extract the contents of the original artifact into the `original` directory alongside the archive. The original artifact contains two folders, the `R_code` folder in which the original R scripts can be found as they were given to us and the `sqlDump` folder, which contains the data. 

```{bash}
cd original
tar -zxf artifact.tgz
cd ..
```

After the original artifact is extracted, the sql data dump must be combined together to produce the two files the rest of the paper is concerned with, namely the `_everything.csv` file containing th entire dataset and th `_newSha.csv` containing filtered data. The original artifact contained the `rebuild.sh` script to produce these files, which can be found in the `original/sqlDump/DATA` directory:

```{bash}
cd original/sqlDump
./rebuild.sh
cd ../..
```
